# Simulating Age Differences in Escalation Bias via Multi-level Adaptive Learning
This repository provides the code for our open-source of simulating escalation bias under multi-level adaptive learning. It is an R function with the following parameter inputs:

#Usage
sim (alpha = .05, Learn = 1000, Phase1, Phase2, Phase3, Phase4, Hit.Prob, 
                 EOC.Strategy.Prob = .5, 
                 LOE.Strategy.Prob = .5,
                 contrast = c(-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1))

#Argument
